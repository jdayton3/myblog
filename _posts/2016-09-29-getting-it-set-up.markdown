Well, Google Analytics and Disqus are set up for my blog!  So now you can comment on what I write, and I can see who you are!  :)

Special thanks to [Desired Persona](https://desiredpersona.com/google-analytics-jekyll/), [Michael Lee](https://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/), [Google](https://analytics.google.com/), and, as always, [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17207458/how-to-add-google-analytics-tracking-id-to-github-pages) for helping me set up Google Analytics.  Couldn't have done it without you.

Also, a special thanks to [Brendan A R Sechter](http://sgeos.github.io/jekyll/disqus/2016/02/14/adding-disqus-to-a-jekyll-blog.html) for writing his incredible article on adding Disqus to a Jekyll blog.  Thanks to [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) too, for making all this possible.

My next steps:

 - SEO -- so someone someday may run across this blog
 - The Bug Tracker
