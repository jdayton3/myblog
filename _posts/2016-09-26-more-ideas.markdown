I'm wondering how hard it would be to add something on my website where I could sign in and click a "add a new post" button and just write something on my website.  I guess that would take a little from the whole "statically served site" idea.

My thoughts are so scattered for writing a blog.  I think that people would be more likely to read a blog that's actually *about* something.  I go to blogs to figure out how to set up something specific, not to hear the ramblings of a 20-something year old guy.  Deep down, do I really want people to read my blog?  Heh, yeah, otherwise I'd just write this all in my journal. 

I'm taking a molecular biology class.  A few interesting things from the day:

 - DNA can come in different types of helices: A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA.  [Learn about it from the NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22585/).  B-helices are the most common in DNA, but A-helices are more common in RNA.  And Z-DNA is also around in limited doses.

 - Actually, that's the one and only interesting thing I can think of.

In other news, my MySQL server, for some reason, gave up the ghost today.  I spent all of my stats class and most of my molecular bio class trying to fix it, but to no avail.  Bummer!  Good thing every little thing is backed up!  We're trying to move from a Google Sheets system to a web-based database system we're building from scratch.  But things like this make me feel a little uneasy about that.

I work in a bioinformatics cancer research lab.  (I appealed a campus parking ticket the other day, and I used that to invent ethos: "I'm such a good person, I try to help people with terminal illnesses, don't charge me for parking in the wrong spot!"  Talked 'em down from $30 to $10.  I'm really getting my money's worth with that persuasive writing class!)  I met with my faculty mentor today, and he told me about a project I can start working on with one of my good friends in the lab.  We are going to be writing a web app that will make downloads of TCGA data a lot easier.  (I recently spent about three weeks parsing and tidying some VCFs -- it's an issue).  I'm excited about that!  Sounds like we might be using a NoSQL database and the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/), neither of which I've used before.  Neat!

If there's anything I wish I could inform a bunch of people out there about today, it's that **in Ubuntu Unity -- probably several other Linux distros as well -- you can use Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Shift+V to copy and paste in the terminal.**  I wish I could get the total two months of my life back that I spent painstakingly \[move pointer over with old Synaptics touchpad, right click, move pointer down the list, *copy*/*paste*\]-ing.  

Lastly, today marks the day that my wife and I became Facebook friends four years ago!  The door of history turns on small hinges.  It's really nice to have her around.
