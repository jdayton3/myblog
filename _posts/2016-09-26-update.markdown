Day two on Jekyll.  

It's pretty slick!  I'm not super familiar with the syntax, but based on my skimming of the first few chapters of [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://poignant.guide/) a few months ago, I think it's Ruby.  Rails.  Maybe.  OK.

Some things I'm wishing I could figure out how to do:  

 - Automatically generate a post.  I'm using vim to write my posts, and I wish I had a command line utility that would allow me to do something like the following: 

~~~ 
$ ./newPost title-of-the-post

-->

new file _posts/current-date-title-of-the-post.markdown:
---
layout: post
title: "Title of the Post"
date:  current date and time

 - Also, an "edit latest" command would be really nice, so I wouldn't have to type in "cd _posts;vim 2[tab]6[tab][tab]..."  I guess I'll probably end up writing said command utilities.
 - Get vim's syntax highlighting figured out so it wouldn't randomly switch back and forth from italics to non-italics (however you say that)
 - Every time I edit a file, I have to restart the Jekyll service because the css stops working.
 - I downloaded the Monokai theme for my code blocks, but it's not working, and that's really a bummer.  I'd like to figure that out.

Well, busy day ahead of me!  TTYL!
