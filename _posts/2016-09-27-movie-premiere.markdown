We went to the world premiere of @DropOffTheMovie yesterday!  It was fun.  We went out to eat with the family at Zupa's first, which was also fun.  My sister and her fiancee also came.  They haven't decided when or where they're going to get married, but my sister's fiancee is pretty set on getting married in Honduras, where his mother lives.

My parents' income is pretty limited, and tickets to Honduras are ranging between $1000 and $1200 for the time they're planning to get married.  I told my mom that if they end up getting hitched in Honduras, she and my dad should go without my siblings and me.  So that's that!

OK, I'm planning to start a "bug tracker" for my blog.  Here's the vision:  I'll have a page with a list of resolved and unresolved "bugs" in my life -- could be anything from "I want to optimize my blog for mobile devices" to "I'm having an impossible time paying attention in class" to "aw heck I need a job."  Each of those "bugs" will link to another entry that will detail my journey to kill that bug.  

Speaking of bugs, I think we have a spider infestation --  I've been bitten two nights in a row, and last night when we got home from the movie, we killed three fairly large spiders around our apartment.  Maybe that could be my first bug to track!

I think this idea would be more interesting if I somehow allowed comments on my blog.  Another bug!

I'm an avid reader of [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/).  I think Randall Munroe's a super talented guy, and I think his comics and "What If?"s are really funny and well thought out.  I don't think that his early comics are that great.  But he keeps cranking out comics every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and now he's really good at what he does.  And I keep thinking, maybe, maybe if I just keep at it, maybe someone I've never met from across the country will read through these old blogs and think, "Wow.  I guess he must have gotten good from keeping at it."
