Hmmm.  Although [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9) does say that "resume" is an acceptable spelling of the word, I did learn how to add special symbols in vim today.  

``` vim
" Show the available options
:digraphs

" In insert mode:
Ctrl+K a' 
" Produces á
```
¡¡¡ŕéśüḿè!!!®

I went to a job fair today at my university.  Having never been to a job fair, all I brought was myself and my winning personality.  I was really curious to know why everyone was carrying folders around and where they got such nice folders.

Ah.  Résumés.  

I talked to quite a few really nice interviewers at quite a few really impressive companies.  I felt a little bit embarrassed and a little bit ashamed every time someone asked me for a résumé.  A couple interviewers gave me their cards and asked if I could email them my résumé tonight.

Vaguely, vaguely I remember writing a r(holy cow, typing "Ctrl+K e '" for one letter is getting overwhelming!  Is CV a valid synonym?  Maybe not..)ésumé, but maybe years ago.  

So I tried a LaTeX template.  I'm pretty new with LaTeX, and after 20 minutes of trying to get my name to display without breaking halfway through "Dayton", I thought that Jekyll might be easier.

So I tried four different templates and settled on the last one.  But I goofed -- I cloned the GitHub repo, started editing it, and pushed it to a new repo.  Then I realized that I really should have forked it.  But I couldn't figure how to do that retroactively.  So yeah.  What terrible open source etiquette I have!

New bug:  is there a way to spell check in vim?  (Are there really people out there who can spell etiquette without Google?)

If you're reading this because you were linked here from my résumé, it's good to have you here! ☺☻☺☻
